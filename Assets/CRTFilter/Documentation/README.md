# Overview

Customizable CRT effect usable either as a full screen effect or on any camera in the project using URP. It uses
high-performance single pass shader to create many CRT "artifacts". This shader can be used separately as well in
advanced scenarios.
**Please read 'Installation instructions' below to properly configure the filter.**
Thanks for using my CRT Filter for URP. If you need any support, please contact me at: curio124@gmail.com

# Installation instructions for full screen CRT effect using Pixel Perfect Camera:

1. **Create a new 2DRenderer or adjust provided ExampleCRTFilter2DRenderer**
You can either create **a new 2DRenderer** anywhere in your assets folder by right-click in the project explorer under Assets
section and selecting **Create->Rendering->URP 2D Renderer**, or you can use (optionally also rename and relocate) provided
**ExampleCRTFilter2DRenderer** file from the Settings subfolder.
2. **URP settings location**
This package is compatible only with the URP, as it uses URP way of adding renderer passes. If the project is configured
properly for the URP, there is an existing URP settings. It's usually located either in the root Assets folder or in the
Settings subfolder with a default name **"UniversalRP"**.
If you have any difficulties to locate URP settings file, open "Project Settings" and select section "Graphics". Used URP
settings file is visible in the first configuration item - "Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings". By clicking on the item,
URP settings file will be located in the project explorer.
3. **URP settings configuration**
note: URP use render passes also for the scene editor. If you change default renderer (first item in the "Renderer List"),
CRT filter will be applied also to the scene editor. Better option is to add another renderer, that will be used only with
selected camera(s), what is described in this step.
Open settings file from the step 2. in the inspector and **add a new renderer to a "Renderer List" by clicking "+" button**
at the end of the "Renderer List". **Add reference to a rendered from the step 1** to a newly created record in the renderer list.
4. **Camera configuration - necessary for the sample scene as well**
Once a new renderer was added to the renderer list in the URP configuration (step 3.), it can be selected for any camera in
the project. **If you wish to see the CRT Filter in the sample scene, camera in the sample scena has to be adjusted as well.**
    1. select the camera to which you would like to apply the CRT filter
    2. find the **"Camera"** component and expand **"Rendering"** section
    3. select proper renderer (from the step 1.) in the **"Renderer"** setting
5. **Configure 2DRenderer**
note: if you've used provided ExampleCRTFilter2DRenderer, it already contains CRT Renderer Feature with proper configuration,
so you may skip this step and all it's substeps
    1. open 2DRenderer from the step 1. in the inspector and scroll down to the section "Renderer Features"
    2. add CRT Filter Renderer Feature by clicking **"Add Renderer Feature"** button at the end of settings list and
    choosing **"CRT Renderer Feature"**
    3. expand section "CRT Renderer Feature" if it's collapsed
    4. rename the name of the feature (there is/was a known issue, if the feature has the same name as the object).
    Name it "CRT Filter" for example.
    5. set the **"Shader"** setting to the **"CRTFilter"** (the provided shader)
6. **Configure CRT Filter**
note: CRT Filter is configured in the 2DRenderer. You may create multiple 2DRenderers with different CRT Filter configuration if you
need it for your game (valid option for in-game monitors).
    1. open 2DRenderer from the step 1. in the inspector and scroll down to the section "Renderer Features"
    2. expand section "CRT Renderer Feature" if it's collapsed
    3. choose any preset to see CRT effect on all properly configured cameras - with selected preset, most values can't be changed
    4. or choose a **"custom" preset** and modify any values to your liking - for more info see 'Reference' below
    5. **!!!IMPORTANT!!!!** for pixel effects (blur, smidge, bleed and to some extent also scanlines) you need to provide
    proper pixel resolution (x and y). This CRT effect takes the texture and no matter what is its real resolution (can be upscaled)
    it processes each pixel on it by this resolution. This makes sense only if you use the filter for pixel/retro graphic style, when
    your game looks like for example 320x240px game even tough resolution is 4x higher (each pixel in the game is in reality 4x4 pixels
    with the same color). CRT filter needs to know that there are 320x240 pixels in the texture to work properly without any artefacts.
7. **Custom color spaces**
If you don't use standard color space, you may want to change the color space for the temporary render color buffer in the
**CRTRendererFeature.cs** class in the OnCameraSetup method.

# ADVANCED - Using CRT effect on other than main camera

You can use CRT filter on any camera in the project and each can have different CRT effect configuration. You may proceed similarly
as in **installation instructions** above and just add proper 2DRenderer to any camera. If more cameras use the same renderer, they will
share CRT filter settings obviously. If you need different settings for different camera(s), you need to create more 2DRenderers.

# ADVANCED - Using CRT filter on non pixel/retro game or camera

This filter can be used on any graphic style (even 3D), although it was created specifically for 2D pixel game using Pixel Perfect Camera.
Specific for 2D games are just pixel effects (blur, smidge, bleed and to some extent also scanlines). Shader checks each VISUAL pixel
(as user sees them - e.g. 320x240) and apply math to effect each TEXTURE pixel (by texture resolution - e.g. 1920x1080). If the texture
is not "pixelated" and this virtual resolution (e.g. 320x240) is not properly set in CRT filter settings, results are not guaranteed and
based on graphical style may be better or worse. Try to play with settings to reach acceptable results.

# ADVANCED - Usage of shader

Main value of this CRT filter is its shader. If you know how, you may use it in your own pipelines to achieve nice effect in some
advanced scenarios. To describe use of shader is out of scope of this doc and also of the CRT filter package itself.

# Requirements

CRT filter requires URP to work properly. Shader can be used also in other pipelines, but provided script and
instructions are implemented for URP.

# Limitations

CRT filter can't be used without component that creates camera texture such as PixelPerfectCamera or postprocessor
on the camera. Any other component that renders to camera texture can be used, but the filter works best with
PixelPerfectCamera and with resolution set to same values in the CRT filter and PixelPerfectCamera componet.

# Reference

CRT filter is configured in the 2DRenderer asset (see 'Installation instructions' above).
Most parameters are either self-explanatory or their effect can be easily seen if changed.
Some important notes:
- if preset is set to any value except "custom", most parameters can't be changed and are fixed by selected preset
- you may choose any preset and then change preset to "custom" to modify all values
- or you may choose preset "none" and then change it to "custom" to start from scratch
- Pixel Resolution X & Y has to be set to the same values as in PixelPerfectCamera component - otherwise
  some effects may be misaligned (see some explanations above)
- smidge effect is design to be used only with the bleed effect, without bleed, smidge doesn't look right
- to set custom offsets for R, G and B, Chromatic Aberration has to be set to 0
- see values used for presets for inspiration

# Troubleshooting

- **sample scene doesn't use CRT filter**
    - if you've opened sample scene in your existing project, your URP settings still use standard renderer.
      You have to configure your URP settings (see 'settings' above) and properly set camera in the sample scene
      to use a renderer that you've properly configured
- **no output of the camera**
    - disable CRT filter in the 2DRenderer to be sure, that camera is working properly without the filter
    - check the console, if there isn't a warning regarding not existing camera texture. If there is the 
      message, make sure there is some component that renders to camera texture (such as PixelPerfectCamera
      with crop enabled or standard camera with postprocessing enabled)
    - try change any other value in 2DRenderer (for example disable and enable post-processing)
- **camera is 'upside-down' during the edit mode**
    - there was a bug introduce with a specific combination of system + unity editor version + URP version.
      It was fixed in the version 1.0.4. If it persist or you have any other issue, pls. contact me at: curio124@gmail.com
- **CRT effect is not visible**
    - make sure, that camera is using proper renderer (camera settings in camera inspector)
    - make sure, that renderer has added CRT Filter and it's enabled
    - make sure, that filter has some settings (if everything is set to 0, there is no effect from the filter)
- **there is an error in the console**
    - try to fix it by yourself - both renderer class and shader is available to you
